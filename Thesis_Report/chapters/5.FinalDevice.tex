\section{Calibration}
Introduction for calibration like we need it after we have all the components with their resistances (connectors, welded points etc)

\subsection{Tools and Setup}
Tools that were used
Circuit of the calibration setup

\subsection{Process}
Initial measurement
Calculation of Correction parameters
Update of atmega code
Final Measurement
Validation of calibration
