\section{Tools and Software}
List of all software packages and tools that were used for the completion of this project

\section{PCB Fabrication}
The process of printing and fabricating a PCB in the Lab of KULeuven

\section{Source Code}
List of the source code for both the atmega and the Raspberry pi

\section{User Manual}
Introduction text for the user manual and why is useful

\subsection{Programming the Measurement PCB - Atmega Code}
How can a user program the on board atmega chip for updated code or calibration process?

\subsection{Programming the Raspberry Pi}
How can a user program the Raspberry Pi for updated code or different set up (dropbox account, different file storing philosophy etc)

\subsection{Connect the PCB to a PV module}
What is the proper and safe way to connect the Measurement PCB to a PV module in order to start logging data?

\section{Power PCB}
Maybe add the designed board for the power and temperature (double function) that was not printed in the end?
