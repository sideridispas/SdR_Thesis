\section{Photovoltaics in general}
General information about PV and the energy market in the moment and past. A few things about the future and the upcoming grouth of the solar energy area..

\section{PV measurements}
In order to characterize PV modules for efficiency etc, we need some measured values. Which values are important and why so?

\subsection{Voltage}
More information about the voltage output of a PV panel..

\subsection{Current}
More information about the current output of a PV panel.. Connection with the efficiency and the energy production

\subsection{Temperature}
Not so common, but important value. A few things about temperature "correction" and efficiency improvement (check Bert's work)

\subsection{Rest environmental conditions}
Humidity, pressure, wind etc
We are not working on that area but they are kind of important. So a few things for that area (check Bert's work again)

\section{State of the art}
Mention the available options for PV monitoring devices of the market, in the current moment

\section{Document structure}
How is the document structured. Brief description of each chapter maybe?\\
Bibliography testing right... here\cite{einstein}
